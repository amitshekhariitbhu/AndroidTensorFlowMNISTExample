# Android TensorFlow MNIST Machine Learning Example

##  About Android TensorFlow Machine Learning MNIST Example
* This is an example project for creating machine learning model for MNIST to detect hand written digits.
* Check [this project](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/AndroidTensorFlowMachineLearningExample) for building tensorFlow for Android.
* Now, there is no need to build the library as the it is now available through maven. Check [this pull request](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/AndroidTensorFlowMNISTExample/pull/1/files).
